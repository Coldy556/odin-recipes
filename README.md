# Odin-recipes

This proyect is about a webpage which will have some links to a few of the recipes I like the most. To achieve this I will be using the very few things I know about html which are how to create an html format file, how to add a title to my webpage, how to make ordered and unordered lists, how to insert links and images, how to add a heading a some paragraphs and how to make words bold or italic.
